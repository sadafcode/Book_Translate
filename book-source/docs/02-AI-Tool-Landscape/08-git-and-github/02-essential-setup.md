# Essential Setup

## What You'll Do

Get Git working on your computer. This takes 20 minutes. You do it once, then never again.

Three simple steps:
1. Install Git
2. Create GitHub account
3. Tell Git your name

Your AI assistant helps with everything.

---

## The AIDD Way

**Old way**: Follow complicated installation guides

**AIDD way**: Ask your AI "Help me install Git" and it guides you

Why this works:
- Your AI adapts to your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Your AI fixes problems as they happen
- You learn to ask for help, not memorize steps

---

## Step 1: Install Git

**What you need**: Git software on your computer

**Instead of**: Finding and following installation instructions

**Just ask your AI**:
- "Help me install Git"
- "I need Git on Windows"
- "Install Git on my Mac"
- "How do I get Git on Ubuntu?"

### Simple Example: Windows

**You**: "Help me install Git on Windows"

**AI**: "I'll guide you:

1. Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Download the 64-bit installer
3. Run the file
4. Click Next through all the options (defaults are fine)
5. Finish

Tell me when done."

**You**: "Installed! How do I check it works?"

**AI**: "I'll check for you..."

[AI verifies installation]

**AI**: "Perfect! Git version 2.42.0 is installed and working."

### Simple Example: Mac

**You**: "I need Git on my Mac"

**AI**: "Easiest way:

1. Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/mac
2. Download the installer
3. Run it
4. Follow the prompts

Let me know when ready."

**You**: "Done!"

**AI**: "Testing it now... Great! Git is installed."

### Simple Example: Linux

**You**: "Install Git on Ubuntu"

**AI**: "I'll install it for you..."

[AI runs the install commands]

**AI**: "Git is installed! Version 2.34.1 is ready to use."

### If Something Goes Wrong

**You**: "I got an error saying 'permission denied'"

**AI**: "That means you need admin rights.

Windows: Right-click the installer → Run as Administrator
Mac: Enter your password when prompted
Linux: I'll use 'sudo' which gives admin access

What's your operating system?"

**You**: "Windows. I'll try as Administrator."

**You**: "It worked!"

**AI**: "Excellent! Git is now installed."

---

## Step 2: Create GitHub Account

**What you need**: An account on GitHub.com

**Instead of**: Figuring out GitHub signup alone

**Just ask your AI**:
- "Help me create a GitHub account"
- "Walk me through GitHub signup"
- "I need a GitHub account"

### Simple Example

**You**: "Help me create a GitHub account"

**AI**: "Go to: https://github.com

Click 'Sign up' (top-right corner)

You'll need:
- Your email address
- A password (make it strong)
- A username (this will be public)

Start signing up, then tell me if you get stuck."

**You**: "It's asking for a username but the one I want is taken"

**AI**: "Try these:
- Add numbers: yourname2024
- Add hyphens: your-name
- Add 'dev': yourname-dev

What would you like to try?"

**You**: "I used alice-dev and it worked!"

**AI**: "Perfect! Your GitHub profile is: github.com/alice-dev

Check your email for a verification link and click it."

**You**: "Verified!"

**AI**: "Great! When GitHub asks about a plan, choose 'Free'.
You can skip any surveys. Your account is ready!"

---

## Step 3: Configure Git

**What you need**: Tell Git your name and email

**Instead of**: Typing configuration commands

**Just ask your AI**:
- "Configure Git with my name"
- "Set up my Git identity"
- "Tell Git who I am"

### Simple Example

**You**: "Configure Git with my name and email"

**AI**: "I'll set that up. What name should I use?"

**You**: "Alice Johnson"

**AI**: "And your email? Use the same email as your GitHub account."

**You**: "alice.johnson@example.com"

**AI**: "Setting up your identity now..."

[AI configures Git]

**AI**: "Done! Git now knows:
- Name: Alice Johnson
- Email: alice.johnson@example.com

All your saves (commits) will show this name."

**You**: "What if I need to change it later?"

**AI**: "Just ask me to update it anytime. I'll change it for you."

**You**: "How do I check it worked?"

**AI**: "Let me show you your settings..."

[AI shows configuration]

**AI**: "Your name and email are saved correctly!"

---

## You're Done!

✅ Git is installed
✅ GitHub account created
✅ Git knows who you are

**You're ready for Lesson 3** where you'll start using Git.

## Key Takeaway

Notice what you did:
- You **asked** your AI for help
- Your AI **adapted** to your computer
- Your AI **verified** everything worked
- You **didn't memorize** any commands

This is how AIDD works. You focus on what you want. AI handles how to do it.

---

## Try With AI

Practice verifying your setup.

**Tool**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or ChatGPT

### Exercise 1: Check Git

Ask your AI:
```
Is Git installed on my computer?
Show me the version number.
```

What to expect: AI checks and confirms Git is working.

### Exercise 2: Check GitHub

Ask your AI:
```
I created a GitHub account. Can you help me verify
it's set up correctly? My username is [your-username].
```

What to expect: AI guides you to check your profile.

### Exercise 3: Check Configuration

Ask your AI:
```
Show me my Git configuration.
Is my name and email set correctly?
```

What to expect: AI displays your settings and confirms they're correct.

### Exercise 4: Fix Problems

If anything went wrong:
```
[Explain the problem]
I'm on [Windows/Mac/Linux]. Help me fix this.
```

What to expect: AI troubleshoots your specific issue.

## What's Next

In Lesson 3, you'll learn the five daily Git tasks:
1. Start tracking
2. Check changes
3. Stage files
4. Save snapshots
5. Backup to cloud

All using simple language with your AI.

**Remember**: Setup is the hardest part. After this, Git gets easy!
