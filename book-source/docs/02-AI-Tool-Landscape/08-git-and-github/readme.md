# Chapter 8: Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development

## Overview

This chapter teaches you how to use Git and GitHub as essential safety mechanisms for AI-assisted development. When working with AI coding assistants like Claude Code or Gemini CLI, Git provides a crucial safety net—allowing you to experiment freely, track every change, and undo mistakes instantly. You'll learn Git not by memorizing commands, but by asking your AI assistant to perform Git operations using natural language.

The chapter follows an **AI-native teaching approach**: instead of traditional command memorization, you'll learn to collaborate with AI assistants to manage version control. This mirrors how professional developers actually work with AI tools—understanding concepts deeply while letting AI handle syntax and execution details.

By the end of this chapter, you'll confidently use Git for safe experimentation with AI-generated code, connect your projects to GitHub for backup and portfolio building, set up a professional IDE with Git integration, and understand collaborative workflows through pull requests.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Recognize why Git is essential** for safe AI-assisted development and explain it in your own words
- **Install and configure Git** on your specific operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- **Create a GitHub account** and understand GitHub as cloud backup and collaboration platform
- **Perform core Git workflows** (init, status, add, commit, push) using natural language prompts to AI assistants
- **Safely undo changes** at different stages using appropriate Git commands via AI guidance
- **Create and use Git branches** to test AI-generated changes before merging to main code
- **Connect local repositories to GitHub** for backup, sharing, and portfolio building
- **Create pull requests** that document AI assistance and demonstrate professional Git workflows
- **Set up a modern IDE** (VS Code, Cursor, or Zed) with Git integration and AI coding extensions
- **Integrate all Git skills** in a realistic capstone project where AI generates code and you manage Git for safety

## Chapter Structure

This chapter contains **9 lessons** organized in two parts:

### Part I: Git Concepts and Commands (Lessons 1-4)

- **Lesson 1**: Why Git Matters with AI Tools (15 min) - Conceptual foundation
- **Lesson 2**: Essential Setup (20 min) - Install Git, create GitHub account, configure
- **Lesson 3**: The Daily Workflow (20 min) - Core five commands (init, status, add, commit, push)
- **Lesson 4**: Safety Net - Undoing Changes (20 min) - Five undo methods with safety warnings

### Part II: AI Workflows, GitHub, IDE Setup, and Capstone (Lessons 5-9)
Apply Git with GitHub, branches, PRs, and IDEs:
- **Lesson 5**: Branches for Experimentation (20 min) - Safe testing with feature branches
- **Lesson 6**: GitHub Integration (20 min) - Connect to GitHub, push/pull, authentication
- **Lesson 7**: Pull Requests and Code Review (20 min) - Collaborative workflows, documenting AI assistance
- **Lesson 8**: IDE Setup and Integration (20 min) - VS Code, Cursor, or Zed with Git and AI extensions
- **Lesson 9**: Capstone Exercise (20 min) - Build calculator project with AI generating all code while you manage Git

## Estimated Time

**Total**: 3 hours (175 minutes)
- **Part I** (Lessons 1-4): 75 minutes
- **Part II** (Lessons 5-9): 100 minutes

Each lesson is designed for 15-20 minutes to maintain engagement without cognitive overload. You can complete the chapter in one sitting or break it into multiple sessions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have completed:

- **Part 1**: Introducing AI-Driven Development (Chapters 1-4) - Understand why AI tools matter
- **Chapter 5**: Claude Code Features and Workflows - Have a working AI assistant (Claude Code)
  - OR **Chapter 6**: Gemini CLI Installation and Basics - Alternative AI assistant (Gemini CLI)
- **Chapter 7**: Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development - Basic terminal navigation

**Assumed Knowledge**:
- Basic computer literacy (file management, opening terminal/command prompt)
- Comfort asking AI assistants questions
- Understanding of AIDD paradigm (AI as co-reasoning partner)

**No prior Git or version control experience required!** This chapter assumes you're a complete beginner.

## Tools You'll Need

### Required Tools

1. **Git** (free, open-source)
   - Installation covered in Lesson 2
   - Download links provided for Windows, Mac, Linux
   - You'll install this during the chapter

2. **GitHub Account** (free)
   - Account creation covered in Lesson 2
   - Step-by-step guidance provided
   - You'll create this during the chapter

3. **AI Assistant** (one of the following)
   - **Claude Code** (recommended if you completed Chapter 5)
   - **Gemini CLI** (alternative if you completed Chapter 6)
   - **ChatGPT web** (fallback for Lesson 1 before AI tools introduction)

### Optional Tools (Covered in Lesson 8)

4. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** - Choose one:
   - **VS Code** (recommended for beginners) - Most popular, great extensions
   - **Cursor** (AI-first development) - Built-in Claude integration
   - **Zed** (modern, fast) - Minimal, growing ecosystem

**Note**: You'll choose and install your preferred IDE during Lesson 8. All three options work equally well with Git and AI assistants.

## Lesson Ending Policy

**Important**: Every lesson in this chapter ends with a single **"Try With AI"** section. There are no additional "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next" sections.

- **Before AI Tools Taught** (Lesson 1): Use ChatGPT web for practice exercises
- **After AI Tools Onboarded** (Lessons 2-9): Use your preferred AI tool (Claude Code or Gemini CLI)

This policy ensures consistency and reinforces the AI-native learning approach throughout the chapter.

## How to Use This Chapter

### Recommended Approach

1. **Complete lessons in order** - Each lesson builds on previous concepts
2. **Do the "Try With AI" exercises** - Hands-on practice is essential
3. **Ask your AI assistant questions** - Don't just read; interact and experiment
4. **Commit frequently** - Practice Git safety throughout the chapter
5. **Complete the capstone** - Integrate all skills in a realistic project

### If You Get Stuck

- **Revisit earlier lessons** - Git concepts build incrementally
- **Ask your AI assistant** - Use natural language to get help
- **Check troubleshooting sections** - Common beginner issues are addressed
- **Use the safety mindset** - Remember: Git lets you undo mistakes, so experiment freely

### Safety-First Philosophy

This chapter emphasizes **safety** throughout:
- You'll learn to commit before major changes
- AI-generated code is always reviewed before accepting
- Destructive commands are clearly marked with warnings
- Branching allows safe experimentation without risk

**Core Principle**: Understand concepts deeply, let AI handle syntax, always validate before accepting changes.
