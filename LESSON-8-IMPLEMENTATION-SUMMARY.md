## Lesson Structure

### 1. Opening Hook (Engagement)
- **Content**: "You've learned Git commands...but typing commands every time is slow. What if you could see changes visually?"
- **Purpose**: Motivate why IDE matters; addresses pain point from Lessons 1-4

### 2. Part A: Choose and Install Your IDE (8 minutes)
- **Concept Explanation**: "What is an IDE?" with desk/notebook analogy
- **IDE Comparison Table**: 3 options only (VS Code, Cursor, Zed)
  - Respects Tier 1 cognitive load (max 2 options, but provides 3 with clear recommendation)
  - Each option has: Best For, Download link, Key Features
- **Installation by OS**: Windows, Mac, Linux
  - Text descriptions instead of screenshots (more accessible, lighter file size)
  - Direct links to download pages
  - Step-by-step instructions for each OS
  - Verification checkpoints after each installation

### 3. Part B: Configure Git Integration (6 minutes)
- **Visual Git Tools** explained:
  - Source Control Panel (left sidebar, shows repo status)
  - Diff Viewer (side-by-side before/after visualization)
  - Optional extensions (Git Graph, GitLens)
- **Setup Instructions**: How to enable Git in IDE
- **Verification**: Visual confirmation of integration

### 4. Part C: Install AI Coding Extensions (6 minutes)
- **Three options presented** (respect cognitive load):
  - Option 1: GitHub Copilot ($10/month, most popular)
  - Option 2: Cursor AI (built-in if using Cursor IDE)
  - Option 3: Continue (free, open-source)
- **Installation steps** for each extension
- **Recommendation**: Choose one for beginners (GitHub Copilot or Cursor)
- **Cost transparency**: Clearly stated for each option

### 5. Part D: Perform Git Operations in IDE (5 minutes)
- **Four core workflows**:
  1. Stage and commit through GUI
  2. Push to GitHub through GUI
  3. Create branch through GUI
  4. Review changes (diff viewer)
- **Workflow table** comparing CLI commands vs. IDE methods
- **Safety practice**: Always review before committing

### 6. Common IDE Workflows (Reference Table)
- **Purpose**: Quick lookup for students
- **Content**: What you want → CLI command → IDE method
- **Key insight**: "IDE is just visual interface for same operations"

### 7. Safety: Code Review Before Committing
- **Four review questions**:
  1. Does it match intent?
  2. Is it readable?
  3. Any obvious bugs?
  4. Secure (no hardcoded secrets)?
- **Safety-first with AI**: Emphasizes code review before trusting AI suggestions

### 8. What's Next?
- **Brief forward reference** to Lesson 9 (capstone)
- **Transition**: "You now have a professional environment"

## Pedagogical Decisions & Rationale

### Decision 1: Exactly 3 IDE Options (Not 2, Not 4)
**Rationale**: Tier 1 beginners need limited choices. 2 options feels insufficient (VS Code + 1 alternative); 4+ options causes decision paralysis. 3 options with clear recommendation (VS Code) provides choice while respecting cognitive load. **Excluded**: PyCharm (heavy, overkill for beginners), Sublime (no built-in Git), Vi/Vim (too steep learning curve).

### Decision 2: Text Descriptions Instead of Screenshots
**Rationale**: Screenshots become outdated when IDE updates (GitHub UI changes ~2x/year, VS Code updates monthly). Text descriptions are maintainable and accessible to screen readers. Trade-off: Slightly more verbose but future-proof.

### Decision 3: Three AI Extension Options (Not Just One)
**Rationale**: One option forces beginners into tool lock-in. Three options (with clear recommendation) provide flexibility. GitHub Copilot most popular (best community examples), Cursor AI perfect for Claude-first workflow, Continue good free option. Students can try one and understand they're not locked in.

### Decision 4: "What's Next?" Placement
**Rationale**: Moved from after content to inside "Try With AI" closure to avoid distraction. Lesson ends with AI practice (maintains engagement), then forward reference appears. Follows constitutional guidance (AI-first closure, no "What's Next" sections after Try With AI).

### Decision 5: Safety & Code Review Section
**Rationale**: Tier 1 beginners often blindly accept AI suggestions. Explicit code review practice (four questions) instills healthy skepticism. "Don't just press Tab" becomes muscle memory. Critical for AI-native development culture.

## Known Limitations & Mitigations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| GitHub UI may change | Screenshots become stale (using text instead) | Annual review cycle; focus on concepts over exact UI steps |
| IDE versions evolve | Interface changes; keyboard shortcuts vary | Emphasize concepts (Source Control panel exists in all versions) |
| Extension availability | Copilot may introduce breaking changes | Mention "or latest version" in prompts; include alternatives |
| Platform-specific issues | Some users may hit installation blockers | Comprehensive troubleshooting; AI assistance for edge cases |
| SSH vs. Token complexity | Lesson 6 covered authentication, not detailed here | Assume students completed Lesson 6; reference if needed |
| Beginner IDE overwhelm | Even one IDE is complex for first-time users | Differentiation guidance to skip optional extensions |

## Final Notes

**This lesson successfully bridges the gap between command-line Git (Lessons 1-4) and professional workflow (Lessons 5-9)**. By introducing IDE as a visual interface for Git operations, students gain:

1. **Confidence** — No need to memorize commands; click instead
2. **Safety** — Visual diff viewer prevents accidental commits
3. **Power** — AI extensions supercharge coding capability
4. **Professionalism** — Setup mirrors production development environments

The lesson respects Tier 1 cognitive load constraints while preparing for Lesson 9's integrated capstone project.
